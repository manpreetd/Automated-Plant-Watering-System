# Automated-Plant-Watering-System

This project presents an automated plant watering system built using an Arduino Uno, soil moisture sensor, OLED display, and water pump. The system monitors the moisture level of soil in real time and activates watering when dryness is detected, reducing the need for manual intervention. Sensor readings are stored in a HashMap and visualized through a dynamic graph using Java and StdDraw. The project leverages Firmata4j for communication between the Arduino and Java application, and applies object-oriented principles to structure components like the pump and display logic. This solution offers an efficient and scalable approach to smart plant care.
